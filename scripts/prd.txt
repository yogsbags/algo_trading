## 2. Backtesting Engine
- What: Historical data simulation engine to test trading strategies
- Why: Critical for validating strategy performance before real money deployment
- How: Event-driven architecture processing historical price/volume data with realistic trading conditions

## 3. Performance Analytics
- What: Comprehensive trading performance metrics and visualization
- Why: Essential for strategy evaluation and optimization
- How: Calculate key metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdown, returns) with interactive charts

## 4. Real-time Trading Integration
- What: Live market data feed and order execution system
- Why: Enables automated strategy execution in real market conditions
- How: Integration with broker APIs for market data and order management
